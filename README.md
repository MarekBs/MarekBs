Hello, my name is Marek, and I am currently in my 4th year of studying Applied Informatics at FEI STU Bratislava. I've always been passionate about new technologies and computers. 
I have basic experience in Java, C, C++, and Python, and you can find some of my projects on my profile.
Recently, Iâ€™ve been focusing on web development and have gained some experience working with React.
I am eager to further develop my skills and would love the opportunity to gain real-world programming experience in a company. Every offer is greatly appreciated!
