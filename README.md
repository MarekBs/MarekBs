Hello, my name is Marek and I am currently studying applied informatics at FEI STU Bratislava 4.th year. 
New technologies and computers were always really interesting for me.
I have some basic experience in Java, C, C++ and python.
You can find some of my projects on my profile. Nowadays I am learning web-dev HTML,CSS,JS, React. I would love to have possibility 
to gain real life experience from programming  in any company. Every offer is highly appreciated.
